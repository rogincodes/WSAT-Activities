# Web Systems and Technologies Activities
#### The activities we completed in our Web Systems and Technologies course. We only learned HTML and CSS from this course.

#### Tech used: HTML/CSS (the only techs we learned from this course)

Note: It was my first experience with web development. So my codes are as messy as they can get, and some designs are not very modern and aesthetic.
