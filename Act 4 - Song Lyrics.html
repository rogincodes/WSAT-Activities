		<h2>[Verse 1]
		<blockquote>
		<pre>Come along with me
To a town beside the sea
We can wander through the forest
And do so as we please
Come along with me
To a cliff under a tree
Where we'll gaze upon the water
As an everlasting dream</pre>	
		</blockquote>

		<h2>[Chorus]
		<blockquote>
		<pre>All of my affections
I give them all to you
Maybe by next summer
We won't have changed our tunes</pre>
		</blockquote>

		<h2>[Verse 2]
		<blockquote>
		<pre>I still want to be
In this town beside the sea
Making up new numbers
And living so merrily</pre>
		</blockquote>

		<h2>[Chorus]
		<blockquote>
		<pre>All of my affections
I give them all to you
I'll be here for you always
And always be for you</pre>
		</blockquote>

		<h2>[Outro]
		<blockquote>
		<pre>Come along with me
To a town beside the sea
We can wander through the forest
And do so as we please
Living so merrily</h2></pre>
